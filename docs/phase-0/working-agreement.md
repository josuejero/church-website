# Working Agreement

## Decision-making
- Project owner: TBD
- Content approver: TBD

## Change workflow
- Small edits (typos, broken links): maintainer can ship same day.
- Schedule changes: require content approver confirmation.
- New pages/sections: require project owner approval.

## Review cadence
- Weekly 15–30 min check-in during Phase 1.
- Emergency fixes as needed.

## Definition of Ready (for Phase 1 tasks)
A task is ready when:
- goal is clear
- acceptance criteria exist
- content (or placeholder) exists
- owner/approver is known
