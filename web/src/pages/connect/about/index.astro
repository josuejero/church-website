      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We are a Christian faith community that is part of the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church.
        Rooted in the Bible and centered on Jesus Christ, we seek to reflect God’s love through worship,
        service, and community outreach.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        As Seventh-day Adventists, we value spiritual growth, healthy living, strong families, and
        compassionate service. We believe the church is not just a building, but a people called to live
        out their faith daily, serving God and our community with humility, integrity, and purpose.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        We welcome individuals and families from all backgrounds to join us as we grow in faith, study
        God’s Word, and prepare for the return of Jesus Christ.

          Jesus Christ – Fully God and fully human, whose life, death, and resurrection provide
          salvation and hope for all.

          and fellowship.
