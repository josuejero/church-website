      <h2>Our commitment</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        First Springfield Seventh-day Adventist Church strives to provide an accessible online experience for everyone,
        including people with visual, hearing, mobility, or cognitive differences. We follow W3C WAI guidance when
        designing new pages and maintaining existing content so you can find worship times, ministry updates, and
        ways to connect without barriers.
      </p>

      <h2>Conformance target</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The site is built with the goal of conforming to WCAG 2.2 Level AA success criteria. We rely on semantic HTML,
        meaningful heading structure, descriptive alt text, high contrast palettes, focus-visible outlines, and
        keyboard-friendly components to support broad accessibility. Every major update goes through accessibility
        review before it goes live.
      </p>

      <h2>Known limitations</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        While we work toward full conformance, there are a few areas that remain in progress:
      </p>
      <ul class="muted">
        <li>
          Third-party giving, prayer, and volunteer tools are hosted on external platforms, and we cannot guarantee that their
          entire workflow meets WCAG 2.2 AA.
        </li>
        <li>
          Live streams and archived media rely on YouTube for playback and captions, so availability depends on the channel host.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some downloadable PDFs and older documents shared on the site have not yet been remediated for assistive technologies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        If you encounter an accessibility barrier, please let us know. Email us at
        <a href={contactEmailHref}>{site.contact.email}</a>, call
        <a href={contactPhoneHref}>{site.contact.phone}</a>, or use our
        <a href={contactPage}>contact form</a>. We aim to respond within two business days and will describe alternative
        ways to access the information or service you need.
      </p>

      <h2>Assessment</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        We combine manual keyboard and screen reader testing with automated checks (for example: Lighthouse, axe, and contrast
        analyzers) whenever we publish new content. After major feature releases we re-run these audits and invite volunteer
        feedback so we can keep improving.
