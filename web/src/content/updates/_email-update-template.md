**Subject line:** lead with the action (cancellation, time change, closure) plus the program and date so it scrolls into inboxes quickly.

**Preview text:** add the brightest detail (new time, safety reminder, follow-up plan) so people who skim the message know why it matters.

**Body:** open with a single sentence that names the impacted gathering or service, states the new state of play, and points people to the updates page for full context. Follow with a short “Quick details” list:
1. What: decision (e.g., “KidZone is postponed” or “Worship service moves online”).
2. When/where: new time, virtual link, or closed doorway.
3. What you need: confirm RSVP, bring a mask, park in Lot B, etc.
4. How we’ll keep you posted: updates page link, text alerts, voicemail line.

**Closing:** remind readers who to email/text if they still have questions, mention the banner/updates page, and add the multi-channel kit note (“This note goes out with the SMS + social/voicemail copy below so everyone sees the change.”).
