title: "SMS opt-in template"
date: 2026-02-12
summary: "Short, opt-in-friendly text alerts that echo the email + updates page messaging."
category: "communications"
draft: true

Keep the message under 160 characters, mention the quick change, and include the updates page URL (or short-code) so everyone can read the full details.

Example structure:
- Line 1: “UPDATED: [service or space] [action] [new time or status].”
- Line 2: “Details & opt-out: [short link to updates page].”

Because this is opt-in only, add “Reply STOP to cancel” or similar at the end of line 2, along with the time you expect to send the next update if the situation evolves.

Pair this text with the email message above and the social/voicemail draft below so the same language runs across every channel.
