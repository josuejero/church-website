## Social posts
- Start with the most important fact (“Sunday service switches to 10:00 AM,” “Youth rehearsal is postponed,” etc.).
- Mention how people can stay in the loop (“See the updates page,” “Click the link in bio,” or “Mute notifications? we’ll text you too”).
- Add a note on why the change happened (weather, maintenance, volunteer shortage) plus any quick instructions (bring an umbrella, plan for parking).
- Finish with a CTA (“Tap for the latest update,” “Share with your small group,” “Hashtag #FirstSpringfieldUpdates”).

Keep each caption/tagline short enough for the platform (Instagram/Facebook caption vs. X/Twitter) and use the same link you included in the email/SMS so readers land on the updates page.

## Voicemail script
1. “Hi, you’ve reached First Springfield [customize role], we wanted to let you know that [service/event] is [new status].”
2. “The full note is on the updates page, we’ll also text/email you the details, and you can call [office/volunteer line] if you need anything right away.”
3. “Thanks for staying connected—we hope to see you on [next service or plan].”

Use the voicemail script for outgoing desk calls or auto-attendants so visitors hear the same tone as the email/SMS/social post. The shared updates page link keeps everyone pointed to one source of truth.
