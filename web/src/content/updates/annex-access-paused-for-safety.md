Work crews discovered a structural concern in the annex hallway that needs tuned-up before we can safely welcome people back through that door. The side entrance, choir suite, and educator offices remain closed to visitors until the engineer signs off on the repairs.

If you had a meeting or rehearsal scheduled in the annex, the schedulers will reach out with an alternate room (usually the sanctuary or fellowship hall). Please direct new space requests to the Church Clerk via the contact form so we can keep every calendar update aligned with the repair timeline.

We’ll also post another update as soon as the inspection passes so the Sunday school classrooms and youth suite can reopen.
