## Overview

We read the Bible together and talk about how to live it out.

## How to get involved

Bring your Bible and join the discussion.

## Daily encouragement

Our Bible Study ministry also curates short-form resources you can open from home. The
[Daily Devotional](/resources/daily-devotional) highlights a thoughtful reflection each day, and the
[Daily Bible Verse](/resources/daily-bible-verse) pairs a single Scripture passage with a brief meditation.
Both are updated regularly to keep your personal Bible study fresh even when you cannot join a group session.
