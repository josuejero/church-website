## Children’s Ministry

Coordinator: Giselle Davey

The mission of the Children’s Ministries Department is to nurture children into a loving, serving relationship with Jesus. We are committed to creating a safe, joyful, and faith-filled environment where children can grow spiritually, emotionally, socially, and mentally while learning how deeply they are loved by God.

We seek to fulfill this mission by providing age-appropriate programs that encourage Bible learning, worship, service, and fellowship, while partnering closely with families to support children’s spiritual growth.

### Our Programs & Meeting Times

- • Sabbath School begins every Sabbath at 10:00 AM, offering engaging Bible-based lessons for children.
- • Children’s Choir Practice takes place every Sabbath from 10:55–11:10 AM, helping children worship God through music.
- • Children’s Church is held on the first and third Sabbath of each month, immediately following the Children’s Story, starting June 2026. Children’s Church is designed for children ages 3–9 and includes Bible stories, crafts, singing, a short sermonette, and snacks. For the safety of all children, parents are required to sign children in and out each Sabbath.
- • Vacation Bible School (VBS): July 28 to July 30 from 6 pm to 7:15 pm.

Through these ministries, we aim to help children grow in faith, build friendships, and develop a strong foundation that will guide them throughout their lives.
