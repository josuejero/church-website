## Overview

Children’s Ministry exists to partner with families in discipling ages 3–9. We bring the Bible to life through storytelling, music, crafts, and service so little ones can discover God’s love, grow in faith, and see how they fit into God’s family.

We provide a safe, welcoming space where children can ask questions, worship, and practice kindness while church volunteers model Christlike character.

## Coordinator

Giselle Davey oversees weekly programs, recruits volunteers, and keeps families informed about upcoming special events. Reach out through the main contact page or the ministry email to connect.

## Our Programs & Meeting Times

- Sabbath School: every Sabbath at 10:00 AM in age-appropriate rooms with Bible stories, activities, and opportunities to pray together.
- Children’s Choir Practice: every Sabbath from 10:55–11:10 AM; kids rehearse simple worship songs so they can bless the congregation with joyful voices.
- Children’s Church: first and third Sabbath each month, immediately after the Children’s Story (ages 3–9; sign-in/sign-out required). The session includes Bible stories, crafts, singing, a short sermonette, and snacks to keep hearts and tummies nourished.
- Vacation Bible School (VBS): July 28–July 30, 6:00–7:15 PM; a high-energy evening series packed with teaching, games, and mission-focused fun.

Ages 3–9 are invited to all of the above activities, and we ask every family to sign children in at drop-off and sign them out at pickup so we can ensure consistent safety.
