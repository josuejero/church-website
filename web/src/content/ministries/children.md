## Children’s Ministry

Coordinator: Giselle Davey

The mission of the Children’s Ministries Department is to nurture children of every age into a loving, serving relationship with Jesus. We are committed to creating a safe, joyful, and faith-filled environment where every child can grow spiritually, emotionally, socially, and mentally while learning how deeply they are loved by God.

We seek to fulfill this mission by partnering closely with families to encourage Bible learning, worship, service, and fellowship through programs that welcome the whole child.

### Our Programs & Meeting Times

- • Sabbath School begins every Sabbath at 10:00 AM, offering engaging Bible-based lessons for children of all ages.
- • Children’s Choir Practice takes place every Sabbath from 10:55–11:10 AM, helping kids worship God through music and shared praise.
- • Children’s Church is held on the first and third Sabbath of each month, immediately following the Children’s Story, starting June 2026. Children’s Church is designed for children ages 3–9 and includes Bible stories, crafts, singing, a short sermonette, and snacks. For the safety of all children, parents are required to sign children in and out each Sabbath. All other Children’s Ministry programs are open to every child in Springfield and beyond.
- • Vacation Bible School (VBS): July 28 to July 30 from 6 pm to 7:15 pm.

Through these ministries, we aim to help children build faith, grow friendships, serve others, and develop a strong foundation that will guide them throughout their lives.
