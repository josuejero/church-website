## Women’s Ministry

Women’s Ministry Team: Yejide Bell, Ada Durand, Maxine Griffiths, Sharon Luszcz

Women’s Ministries exists to nurture, empower, and equip women to grow in their relationship with Jesus Christ and to use their God-given gifts in service to others. Our ministry provides a supportive and welcoming environment where women of all ages and backgrounds can connect, grow spiritually, and encourage one another.

Through Bible study, prayer, fellowship, outreach, and service, Women’s Ministries seeks to strengthen faith, build meaningful relationships, and support women in their homes, church, and community. We are committed to uplifting women, fostering spiritual growth, and inspiring lives of purpose, compassion, and leadership in Christ.

“Meeting Time: Women’s Ministries meets regularly on the first Tuesday of every month from 6:00–8:00 PM. Each month features a variety of programs, including Bible studies, health care education, and support-focused discussions, designed to meet the spiritual and practical needs of women.”
