## Social Ministry

Our Social Ministry brings intentional hospitality to First Springfield—creating meals, fellowship nights, celebrations, and shared meals that welcome members and neighbors alike.

### Events & Fellowship

• Community-friendly potlucks, seasonal celebrations, and dessert socials help us stay connected after worship and during special seasons.
• Hospitality is also woven into milestone events such as graduations, anniversaries, and fellowship after memorials or outreach programs.
• The Social Committee partners with other ministries (like Adventist Community Services and Vacation Bible School) to make sure every gathering feels warm and well-planned.

### Join the Committee

To suggest a gathering, bring a recipe, or help serve, email the Social Committee (Teddy Williamson · David McKenzie) at [firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com](mailto:firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com). Volunteers are welcome for setup, clean-up, decorating, and hospitality teams.
