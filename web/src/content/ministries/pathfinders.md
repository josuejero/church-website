## Overview

Pathfinders and Adventurers form one ministry that centers on Christlike discipleship, fun, and service. Adventurers gives younger children and their families a chance to learn Bible stories, character development, and community service, while Pathfinders challenges older youth to grow as leaders, serve the campus, and step confidently into mission opportunities.

## Adventurers

Adventurers helps kids grow in faith, friendships, and family involvement through hands-on activities, badges, and shared worship. Parents and guardians join the journey so the whole family can celebrate small wins and practice faith at home.

## Pathfinders

Pathfinders keeps teens engaged with outdoor adventures, outreach, and intentional leadership training so they can model what it means to follow Jesus in every season of life.

## Director & meetings
