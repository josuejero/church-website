## Overview

“The Seventh-day Adventist Church’s Adventurers and Pathfinders Clubs are Christ-centered programs designed to nurture children and youth in their spiritual, mental, physical, and social development.”

Pathfinders & Adventurers Club Director: Daunette Lemard-Reid

Meeting Time: First and Third Sabbath of each month, from 3:00 PM – 5:00 PM.

## Adventurers

“The Adventurer Club is a fun, Christ-centered program for children ages 4–9 that helps them grow spiritually, socially, mentally, and physically. Through hands-on activities, Bible learning, games, and service projects, children build faith, character, confidence, friendships, and life skills in a supportive, family-focused environment while preparing for the Pathfinder journey ahead.”

## Pathfinders

“Pathfinders are a worldwide organization of young people sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with nearly 2 million members around the globe. Young people of any religious persuasion, or none at all, are welcome and encouraged to join the organization.”

• Pathfinders (ages 10–15) provides opportunities for youth to grow in leadership, teamwork, and personal responsibility through outdoor activities, community service, spiritual growth, and practical life skills.
