## Sabbath School

Superintendent: Elder Paul Moulema

Assistant Superintendent: Carol Elliott

“Time: Sabbath 10 am”

“For Seventh-day Adventists, the goal of Sabbath School is much more than studying a lesson, it’s about making disciples. At its core, Sabbath School exists to help people grow in a saving relationship with Jesus Christ through the study of the Bible, fellowship, mission, and outreach. It is designed to nurture spiritual growth, strengthen faith, and equip members to live out the gospel in practical ways.”

“The key goals of Sabbath School in the Seventh-day Adventist Church are to:”

“• Study the Word of God – Deepening understanding of the Bible and its application to daily life.”

“• Build Fellowship – Creating a caring, supportive community where members connect, encourage one another, and grow together.”

“• Promote Mission – Inspiring participants to share the gospel locally and globally through service, outreach, and giving.”

“• Nurture Discipleship – Helping members develop Christlike character and actively follow Jesus in their personal and public lives.”

“In essence, Sabbath School supports the church’s mission by preparing believers to know Christ, grow in Christ, and share Christ with others—beginning each Sabbath morning in worship, study, and community.”
