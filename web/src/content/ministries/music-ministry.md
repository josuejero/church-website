## Music Ministry

Our Music Ministry invites voices, instruments, and hearts of every age to lift Jesus in worship. We celebrate a variety of musical traditions that reflect Springfield’s diverse congregational family—from gospel choirs and praise teams to orchestral and acoustic specials.

### Choirs & Ensembles

• Adults, youth, and children rehearse together and separately during the week so each Sabbath service includes a thoughtful blend of voices, instrumental praise, and moments for congregational singing.
• Special music is coordinated for holidays, communion weekends, evangelism events, and community outreach services.

### Participation & Contact

Everyone is welcome to join, whether you read music or simply love to sing. Reach out to Music Director Berline Guirand at [firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com](mailto:firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com) to learn which ensemble is a good fit, discover rehearsal schedules, or request a piece for an upcoming worship service.
