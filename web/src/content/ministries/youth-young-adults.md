## Youth & Young adults ministry

“Our Youth and Young Adult Ministries are dedicated to helping young people grow in faith, purpose, and community as they navigate the important seasons of life. We strive to create a Christ-centered environment where youth and young adults can build meaningful relationships, deepen their walk with God, and discover their role in the church and the world.”

“Through worship, fellowship, service, and meaningful conversations, our Youth and Young Adult Ministries seek to support, empower, and inspire young people to live out their faith with confidence and purpose.”

AY Director: Anthia Elliott

AY Assistance Director: Yolann Guirand
