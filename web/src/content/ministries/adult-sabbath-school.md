## Mission Statement

The Mission of the Adult Sabbath School Department of the First Springfield Seventh-day Adventist Church is to provide structured opportunities for its members and visitors to experience a living relationship with Jesus Christ through an emphasis on prayer, member care, service, and Bible study.

## Goals and Objectives

  <div class="card stack--tight">
    <h3>Prayer</h3>
    <p>
      We recognize that prayer is a primary foundation of Spiritual life. Therefore, each class will
      spend time in group prayer. Ample opportunity will be made to receive prayer requests, and prayer
      will be made not only by class leaders, but individual members will pray for class needs, church
      needs, and the overall importance of each person being filled with the Holy Spirit.

    <h3>Member Care</h3>
    <p>
      We recognize that each individual is a part of the larger body, and that Scripture calls us to
      care for one another. Therefore, each class will spend time in discerning the needs of its
      members, and planning ways to reach out and meet those needs. Obeying the Scriptural injunction
      to "Bear one another's burdens," we will seek to lift the spiritual, social, emotional, and
      financial needs of our brothers and sisters within the family of God as we have opportunity.
      Each class will seek to reach out to its inactive or missing members in a regular and consistent
      manner.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card stack--tight">
    <h3>Service</h3>
    <p>
      We recognize that God has directed that service be the criteria by which greatness is measured.
      Following our Lord's example, each class will plan and execute a service program in some area of
      need. Such programs will range from practical help given to needy persons to evangelistic or
      missionary work in the Pioneer Valley area, or even in the larger world field as God leads.
      Opportunities will be provided to receive training that will facilitate the outreach of the
      Sabbath School program.
    </p>

  <div class="card stack--tight">
    <h3>Bible Study</h3>
    <p>
      We recognize that the study of Scripture is the primary way that we may come to know our Lord
      Jesus Christ and the power of His gospel. Seeking to increase our understanding of Scripture,
      each class will spend time in appropriate and relevant Bible study, using either the Adult
      Sabbath School Quarterly, or other materials approved by the Sabbath School Council. New classes
      will be encouraged to form that center around shared interests and needs as it pertains to
      applying Scripture to all aspects of our lives.
