## Secretary/Communications

Church Clerk: Myrna L Leiper

Assistant Bulletin Secretary: Loreli Gaetki

This team keeps office records straight, shepherds member communication, and stewards the weekly bulletin that links congregants to worship plans, volunteer needs, and outreach invites. We coordinate with pastors, ministry leads, and volunteers so every voice is represented in print and online.

### Weekly updates

- [Add weekly bulletin (link)](/resources/bulletins)
- [Add weekly announcements (link)](/resources/announcements)

Need to send an announcement, update attendance, or ask a question about the bulletin? Reach out at the church office email above and we will walk you through the submission window for the coming Sabbath.

### Secretary page upgrade (paid add-on)

- Goal: build a dedicated Secretary/Communications page that highlights the office team, provides quick links to weekly bulletins and announcements, and surfaces the forms or contact points people use when they need to submit news, request a room, or update attendance.
- Deliverables to capture once available:
  1. Hero headline + description that frames the communications ministry and the secretary’s role.
  2. Contact block with office hours, phone/email, and a “submit an announcement” CTA linked to the existing bulletin/announcements workflow.
  3. Download links or embeds for the weekly bulletin/announcement PDFs (pulled from `/bulletins`).
  4. Accessibility/access instructions plus any additional microcopy the vendor was asked to provide.
- Keep this section updated with finalized copy or design notes so the vendor can replace the temporary placeholder content as soon as the assets arrive.
