## Secretary/Communications

Church Clerk: Myrna L Leiper

Assistant Bulletin Secretary: Loreli Gaetki

This team keeps office records straight, shepherds member communication, and stewards the weekly bulletin that links congregants to worship plans, volunteer needs, and outreach invites. We coordinate with pastors, ministry leads, and volunteers so every voice is represented in print and online.

### Weekly updates

Need to send an announcement, update attendance, or ask a question about the bulletin? Reach out at the church office email above and we will walk you through the submission window for the coming Sabbath.
