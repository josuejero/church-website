“At First Springfield Seventh-day Adventist Church, our mission is to humbly and lovingly serve the residents of the Pioneer Valley, the City of Springfield, and surrounding cities and towns. We seek to share the message of Jesus in tangible and meaningful ways by serving the whole person, a Christ-centered approach known as holistic ministry.”

“Throughout Jesus’ earthly ministry, He consistently modeled a holistic approach to caring for humanity, especially those who were marginalized, disadvantaged, and disenfranchised. He met people where they were, addressed their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs, and offered hope, dignity, and restoration.”

“As Ellen G. White beautifully wrote: “Christ’s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The Savior mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them, ‘Follow Me.’””

“Through our Community Services ministry, we strive to follow Christ’s example, serving with humility, compassion, and love, and reflecting God’s grace to all.”

“Monthly Activities: Our community service programs are open to the public, and volunteers are always welcome to join us in serving others.”
