summary: "He Has Risen special worship on Easter Sabbath, April 4."
---
Celebrate "He Has Risen" on Sabbath, April 4, at 11:15 AM in the sanctuary. The worship service will feature the choir, youth drama, and an Easter message that explores the hope of the resurrection for every season.

The music and drama teams will lead fresh arrangements of beloved hymns, and we will close with a candlelight benediction and the congregation singing together. Fellowship refreshments will follow in the foyer so visitors can stay and connect.

Plan to invite friends and neighbors, and if you have a musical gift to share, email <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "He Has Risen" in the subject.
