summary: "Study Jesus' Sermon on the Mount right after the Divine Service on Feb 28."
---
Stick around after the Divine Service on Saturday, February 28, for a Matthew 5 Bible study in the fellowship hall. We'll read the Beatitudes together, ask what Jesus' message means for our neighborhoods, and pray for the courage to live the Sermon on the Mount.

The discussion will include guided questions, a short historical note, and space for prayer requests. Bring a Bible, a notebook, and your curiosity.

Questions or ideas for future passages? Reply to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> and the discipleship team will follow up.
