Our sanctuary host team is finishing a short series of upgrades, so Sabbath worship will begin at 10:45 AM on February 5 instead of 10:30 AM. Please arrive a few minutes early if you would like to help with setup or welcome guests.

The youth choir will still lead the first hymn, and the sermon will follow the welcome at 11:00 AM.
