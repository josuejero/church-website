summary: "Guest Speaker Sabbath on March 21 welcomes a visiting speaker and devotional conversation."
---
Join us for Guest Speaker Sabbath on Saturday, March 21, at 11:15 AM in the sanctuary. We will welcome a visiting speaker from our conference who will encourage us in discipleship, community engagement, and faithful witness in Springfield.

After the message, the guest will stay for a short conversation time where you can ask questions and hear how God is leading our wider union. We'll also invite the congregation to share prayer requests for the speaker's ministry.

If you have questions you'd like to pass along in advance, reply to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "Guest Speaker" in the subject.
