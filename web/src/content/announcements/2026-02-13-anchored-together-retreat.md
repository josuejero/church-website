"Anchored Together" is a couples retreat that runs Friday evening through Saturday afternoon, February 13-14, at a nearby retreat center. It blends worship, guided conversation, and restful space so married and engaged couples can reconnect with each other and with Christ.

Friday night begins with supper, a devotion, and small-group conversation. Saturday includes breakfast check-in, worship, practical breakout sessions on communication and mission partnership, and time for prayer before returning home for Sabbath rest.

Space is limited to twelve couples, so register by Tuesday, February 4, by emailing <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with your names and any dietary needs. A modest love offering will help cover meals and materials.
