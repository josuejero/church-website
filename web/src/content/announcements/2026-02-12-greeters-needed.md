summary: "Volunteers are needed to welcome worshipers on upcoming Sabbaths."
---
We are assembling a welcome team for the next few Sabbaths and need greeters who can arrive by 9:30 AM to open doors, hand out bulletins, and help guests find seating and children's programs.

Our official greeter coordinator is still being confirmed, so for now just reply to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "Greeter volunteer" in the subject and list the Sabbaths you are available. We will host a short orientation before your first shift so you feel confident in the role.

This is a perfect opportunity for people who smile easily, love meeting new neighbors, and want to share the warmth of First Springfield every week.
