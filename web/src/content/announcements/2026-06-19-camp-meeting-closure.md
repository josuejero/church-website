Our church family plans to attend the Atlantic Union Camp Meeting June 19-27, 2026, so campus activities will pause while we gather there. The campus will be closed on Sabbath, June 20, and Sabbath, June 27, while staff, volunteers, and ministry leaders worship and connect at camp.

Members who can't travel are invited to watch the online services (link to be shared closer to the date) or join the small fellowship group that will host a prayer gathering on the campus bridge during those Sabbaths.

We expect to reopen the campus on Sunday, June 28. Questions about the closure or prayer requests can be sent to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com>.
