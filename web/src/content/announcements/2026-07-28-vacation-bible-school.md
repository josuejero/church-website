Vacation Bible School (VBS) returns Tuesday-Thursday, July 28-30, from 6:00 to 7:15 PM each evening. Children ages 4-12 are invited to dive into Bible stories, crafts, worship songs, and service projects that celebrate Jesus' love.

Registration is open now; families can sign up by replying to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "VBS registration" in the subject and listing child names, ages, and any allergies.

We also need adult and teen volunteers to shepherd groups, lead stations, and bless kids with snacks. If you can help, reply to the same email and share your availability.
