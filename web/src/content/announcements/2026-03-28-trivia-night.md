summary: "Trivia Night on March 28 is a fellowship-driven evening of teams, snacks, and missions."
---
Trivia Night is Saturday, March 28, at 6:30 PM in the fellowship hall. Teams of four to six will face off on Bible stories, Adventist history, pop culture, and lighthearted surprises while we take short breaks for prayer and a surprise devotion.

Bring a snack to share, and we will host a potluck-style table with beverages between rounds. Entry is free, but a small donation will support Youth & Young Adults Ministry outreach and missions.

Reserve your table by emailing <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "Trivia Night" in the subject and the names on your team.
