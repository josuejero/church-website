We are keeping the annex closed while our safety team confirms the building is secure following a recent incident. There is no indication of ongoing danger, but we are pausing access until inspectors finish their report and any repairs are completed.

We will publish a full update as soon as the safety review is complete so families and ministry leaders can plan ahead. Until then, please avoid scheduling meetings or dropping items in the annex.

Questions may be directed to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com>, and the welcome team will help route those requests once we have a confirmed reopening date.
