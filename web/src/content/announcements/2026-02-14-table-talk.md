summary: "Table Talk returns after the Divine Service on Feb 14 for youth and young adults."
---
Table Talk is back on Saturday, February 14, immediately after the Divine Service in the fellowship hall. This monthly conversation gives youth, young adults, and their friends a safe place to ask questions about faith, mission, relationships, and everyday choices.

A short devotion kicks off the evening, followed by small-group conversations while we enjoy light refreshments shared by the youth team. Bring a question, a listening ear, or a friend who is exploring faith.

Questions or topic suggestions can be sent to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "Table Talk" in the subject.
