Nar-Anon now meets Monday evenings at 7:00 PM in the fellowship hall. The gathering lasts about 90 minutes and offers a safe space for families and friends affected by addiction.

The meeting format mixes short readings, reflection, and open sharing, and all are welcome to join whether you are new to Nar-Anon or returning. There is no cost, and confidentiality is respected by the hosts.

For more information, email <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "Nar-Anon" in the subject and the volunteer hosts will connect you with the right resources.
