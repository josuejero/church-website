The Church Board meets Tuesday, February 10, at 7:30 PM in the church office conference room. We will review the current quarter's budget, approve the spring outreach calendar, and identify volunteer needs for upcoming ministries.

Board members and ministry leaders are asked to confirm their attendance by replying to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com>, and a livestream link will be shared for those who cannot join in person. Observers with a ministry update are welcome; just let the clerk know ahead of time so we can reserve time on the agenda.
