The Church Board meets Tuesday, February 10, at 7:00 PM in the church office conference room. We will finalize the quarterly budget, review the spring outreach calendar, and identify volunteer needs for upcoming ministries.

Board members and ministry leaders should confirm their attendance by replying to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com>. Please submit agenda items by Saturday, February 8, so the clerk can distribute a balanced schedule, and observers with a ministry update may request time by letting the clerk know ahead of the meeting. A livestream link will be shared with anyone who cannot join in person.
