summary: "Christmas program with music, drama, and candlelight on Dec 19."
---
Save the date for our Christmas program on Saturday, December 19, at 5:00 PM in the sanctuary. We will present music, drama, and candlelight reflections that tell the story of Jesus' birth.

Choirs, youth ensembles, and drama teams will share seasonal favorites, and we will conclude with a community candlelighting and the final chorus of "O Holy Night." Guests are welcome, so bring neighbors and family.

After the program, the foyer will host a cookie reception; if you can bring a tray or help greet visitors, email <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> with "Christmas program" in the subject.
