summary: "Youth and young adults lead worship during Youth Sabbath on Feb 14."
---
Join us for Youth Sabbath on Saturday, February 14, when the Youth & Young Adults Ministry team leads the Divine Service. Youth musicians, testimony teams, and a message from our young leaders will highlight how they are living out their faith in school, work, and community.

We will also pause for a short moment of gratitude, and the youth hospitality crew will host a simple fellowship lunch after worship so everyone can continue the conversation.

Want to support the youth team or share a prayer? Email <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> and the youth ministry leaders will connect with you.
