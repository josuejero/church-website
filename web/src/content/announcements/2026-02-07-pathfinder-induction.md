Join the Pathfinders & Adventurers Club for its 2026 induction ceremony during the Divine Service on Sabbath, February 7. We will pause the main worship midway through the service to officially welcome new Pathfinders, celebrate the leaders, and bless the year of camping, community service, and spiritual growth ahead.

Volunteers are especially welcome to help with hospitality, coordinating the ceremony, and keeping the children's corner calm so families can stay focused on fellowship. Reply to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> by Wednesday, February 5, with the roles you can cover, and we will follow up about greeter assignments and refreshments for the reception that follows.
