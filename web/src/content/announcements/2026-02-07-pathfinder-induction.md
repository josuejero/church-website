Join the Pathfinders & Adventurers Club for our induction ceremony and spring kickoff on Friday, February 7, at 6:30 PM in the fellowship hall. We'll recognize new members, share a brief devotion, and close with fellowship snacks so families can meet the leaders before the upcoming camping season.

Volunteers are especially welcome to serve as greeters, prep the refreshment tables, and help with badge ribboning. If you can lend a hand, reply to <firstspringfieldsda@gmail.com> by Wednesday, February 5, so we can coordinate setup and childcare for the youngest guests.
