## Reflection

Patient faith is not idle; it is steady obedience. When we feel stuck between the promise and the provision, God invites us to keep praying, keep loving, and keep showing up for the next right thing. In that surrendered rhythm, His peace quietly surfaces.

## Prayer

Jesus, help me keep my gaze on you while I wait, knowing you are already working behind the scenes to bring your good plans to light.
