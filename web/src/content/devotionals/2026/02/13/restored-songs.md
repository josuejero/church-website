## Reflection

When we carry guilt or regret, it’s tempting to stay quiet—but the Spirit invites us to remember how He has already forgiven and now redeems every sorrow into praise. Let your next step be gratitude and a small act of generosity.

## Prayer

Lord, lift the weight from my shoulders and help me sing the songs you have restored in my heart.
