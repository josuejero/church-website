## Reflection
Mercy looks like breath that comes deep from the Father, steadying our hearts even when the path ahead feels unclear. Instead of forcing answers, we pause, pray, and let the Spirit remind us that love is already sufficient.

## Prayer
Lord, soften my busy mind and draw me near to the calm of your mercy.
