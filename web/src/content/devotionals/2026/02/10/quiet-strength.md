title: "Quiet Strength"
summary: |
  Our strength grows when we stop striving and stand under God's promise to renew weary souls. This reflection leans on Isaiah 40 and invites gentle waiting, not hurried fixes.

## Reflection
God's strength is not a quick fix but a deepening confidence. When we let go of the illusion that we must fix everything ourselves, we feel the Holy Spirit breathe new patience into our day.

## Prayer
Heavenly Father, remind me that strength is born in stillness with you.
